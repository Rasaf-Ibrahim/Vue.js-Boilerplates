### Theory (Surface Color)

Surface color can also be called the **primary color** or the **main color**.




&nbsp;

### Background Classes (Surface Color)

&nbsp;


**Type-1**

| Class Name | Explanation                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| bg-s-t1a1  | Surface color (Type 1) with alpha channel's value no.1 |
| bg-s-t1a2  | Surface color (Type 1) with alpha channel's value no.2 |
| bg-s-t1a3  | Surface color (Type 1) with alpha channel's value no.3 |
| bg-s-t1a4  | Surface color (Type 1) with alpha channel's value no.4 |



**Type-2**

| Class Name | Explanation                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| bg-s-t2a1  | Surface color (Type 2) with alpha channel's value no.1 |
| bg-s-t2a2  | Surface color (Type 2) with alpha channel's value no.2 |
| bg-s-t2a3  | Surface color (Type 2) with alpha channel's value no.3 |
| bg-s-t2a4  | Surface color (Type 2) with alpha channel's value no.4 |

**Note:**

You will hardly use type 2 of surface color.

| text-s-t2a4 | Surface color (Type 2) with alpha channel's value no.4 |


**Note:**  

Especially, surface text (font) color is needed when you are working with **SVG**. Other than that, surface font color doesn't have much use.

&nbsp;

## Layer Concept

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
### Layer-0, Layer-1, Layer-2

&nbsp;

**Layer-0**

All website has a main background color. The main background is also called as the  primary color. Here, we are calling it the surface color. So, surface color is actually  the main background color/primary color.  We can consider the surface color as `Layer-0`.

Here, we have also created some variation of surface color by changing the alpha channel's value slightly. The change is very minimal. So, we consider all the variation as `Layer-0` too.  Example:  Suppose, our website's surface color is `bg-s-t1a1` &We have a card on our website. The card's color is a variation of the surface color (`bg-s-t1a3`). The card's color will be considered as `Layer-0`.



**Layer-1**

Suppose, we have a alert on our website. The alert's is not using surface color or any variation of it. Suppose, it's using a specific color(red). Here, the specific color(red) is  on top of the  surface color. So, we will consider the alert's color (specific color) as `Layer-1`

If the alert was using a brand color, it would be the same. The brand color would be on the top of the surface color. So, we would consider the alert's color (brand color) as `Layer-1`.



**Layer-2**

On the previous example, there was an alert with specific color. The alert's color was considered as `Layer-1` color.

Now, suppose, on top of the alert, there is button with a brand color. Now, the button color's will be considered as `Layer-2`


&nbsp;
### Layer-1 color vs Layer 2 color (When to use what)

&nbsp;

**Rule of thumb**


- On the `surface` background color, use the layer-1's classes. Even if we use variation (different alpha channel's value) of  `surface` background color, we need use the layer-1's classes on top of that.  

- On the top of  `brand` color  `specific` color, use the layer-2's classes.



**Necessity of the layer-1 & layer-2 text color**

- When the `surface` background color is light, the layer-1 text color provides a dark color. On the contrary, when the `surface` background color is dark, the layer-1 text color provides a light color.

- When we use the `brand` or `specific` background color over the `surface` color, the background color of `brand` or `specific` is dark if the `surface` color is light and the background color of `brand` or `specific` is light if the `surface` color is dark.

- So, if we use the layer-1 text color over the `brand` and `specific` background color, that will not be right. Because layer-1 text color depends on the `surface` color and  will be light on the light `brand` or `specific` color and dark on the dark `brand` or `specific` color.

- That's why, we need to use layer-2 text color over the `brand` or `specific` background color. It  will be dark on the light `brand` or `specific` color and light on the dark `brand` or `specific` color.





&nbsp;
***
&nbsp;

## How to switch to the Dark Mode

&nbsp;



Same classes will be used for both the light and the dark mode. Light mode is the default mode. To switch from light to the dark mode, we need to use the `.dark` class to the parent element.


**Example - Light Mode:**

```html

<div>

    <div class="bg-s-t1a1">

        The most popular sport in Bangladesh is cricket.

    </div>

</div>

```



**Example - Dark Mode:**

```html

<div class="dark">

    <div class="bg-s-t1a1">

        The most popular sport in Bangladesh is cricket.

    </div>

</div>

```

## Style Guide (Recommended)

> [ðŸ”– Use shadow with surface color's variation](#use-shadow-with-surface-colors-variation)
>
> [ðŸ”– Rule of thumb](#rule-of-thumb)


&nbsp;

### Use shadow with surface color's variation

&nbsp;


- The main surface color is the `bg-s-t1a1` or, `bg-s-t2a1`.

- Usually, we use other surface color classes like `bg-s-t1a2`, `bg-s-t1a3` `bg-s-t1a4` on top of the main surface color (`bg-s-t1a1`).

- When we use the other surface color classes on top of the main surface color, we can use `-shadow-xs` class with them.

- Shadow will help to stand out `bg-s-t1a2`, `bg-s-t1a3`, etc  on top of  the main (`bg-s-t1a1`) surface color .

**Example**


```html
<div class=bg-s-t1a1>

    Main Surface color


    <div class=bg-s-t1a2 -shadow-xs>

        Other Surface colors


    </div>

</div>

```


&nbsp;
### Rule of thumb

&nbsp;

- Main Background Color = `bg-s-t1a1`
- No content will have the same background color as the website's main background color (`bg-s-t1a1`). So, every section  has to have a different variation of the surface color. Any random section on the website = `bg-s-t1a3`, `-shadow-xs`

- Navbar =   `bg-s-t1a3`, `-shadow-md`

- Footer =   `bg-s-t1a2`,  `shadow-inner`
- Card = `bg-s-t1a3`, `-shadow-sm`
- Website title, any heading = brand color (`bg-b-t1l1a1`) or any variation of  the brand color.

- Any random small section = `bg-b-t1l1a1`, `text-l2a1`
