## Way to add Bulma with a newly installed nuxt project

### 1. Installation

```
npm install bulma

npm install bulma-start

```
bulma-start is a tiny npm package that includes the npm dependencies you need to build your own website with Bulma.

### 2. Edit nuxt.config.js

```
export default {

css: [ 'bulma'
  ]

}
```



## What's inside

1. In the 'components' folder, there is a 'bulmaExample.vue' file where I have used Bulma. There I have maintained my prefer style of writing html and css framework's class which I have found to be easier to look at and understand.  And in the bottom section of that file, I have written some rules of how I will write html and css framework's class.
